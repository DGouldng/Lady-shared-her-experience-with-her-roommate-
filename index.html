          Yeah, relationships can definitely be tricky sometimes! Nigerian lady, @praiseoghre, shared her experience about her roommate inducing her to break up with her boyfriend, only for the roommate to end up marrying him years later. Life can be full of unexpected twists and turns!
        </p>
        <p>
          So, according to her recount, the lady mentioned that her roommate actually disliked her boyfriend initially, but then started dating him just six months after they broke up. It's surprising how things can change in relationships, isn't it? üòÆ

            So, while sharing her story on the microblogging platform X, she wrote about her experience... stated below:

          "While I was in 100L there was this guy who was so nice to me, although he wasnt financially stable but he tried the best he could to make me happy. My roommate then h@t‚Ç¨d him and would ground at the sight of him, she would say "I need a better man. A working-class man, not a student"...
        </p>
        <p>
          To make matters worse, the iPhone 7 my dad bought for me on my 17th birthday fell in water and stopped working and I couldn't tell my dad cos the phone was barely 2 months old.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next evening, I was surprised to see him with an itel android phone he asked me to manage for the time being... While promising me that when he receives fees from his students he would get me something better (he takes students extra classes). 
        </p>
        <p>
          My friend was so mad that night, she insulted him saying ‚Äúwho still uses itel phone in this era?‚Äù To cut the story short, I finally left him to please my friend. But guess what? This guy is now a medical doctor in the US. He just got engaged to a woman! Guess who? MY ROOMMATE.
        </p>

        <p>
          They are both in the US together, I heard that after he graduated, he got a scholarship He told the school he was married, and had to take my friend along because they started dating 6 months after we broke up. Nneka, if you get to see this‚Ä¶ God will give you what you deserve."
